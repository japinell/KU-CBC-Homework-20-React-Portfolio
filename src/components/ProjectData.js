      "A Javascript web application that allows users to search and filter restaurants by using predefined search fields. The application provides users with a list of restaurants near by and information on whether the restaurant delivers food to the customer or not. A key feature is that it provides nutritional facts about the chosen food. Finally, the application was developed in conjunction with other students attending the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at Kansas University. In this project, I fulfilled the roles of Project Manager and Full Stack Developer. Interested in learning more about this application?

      "A NodeJS application that allows users to organize event details and guest preferences. It allows users to register for an account before they are able to create events. Events information is persisted in a MySQL database, and retrieved and/or updated through the use of APIs. The application features the use of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm. The application was developed in conjunction with other students attending the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at Kansas University. In this project, the team followed best practices for Agile Project Management, and extensively used the Projects feature in GitHub, along with branching, pull requests, merging, and issue tracking.

      "A NodeJS application for managing employees for a small company. The application makes it easy for end users to view and interact with information stored in the database. It allows users to Add departments, roles, employees; View departments, roles, employees; and Update employee roles. A key feature of the application is that it runs without a graphical interface for the front-end; instead, it uses Inquirer.JS to ask users predefined questions and act upon their responses. This might be useful in cases where a 'light-weight' application is needed, for instance, for remote server or service administration, or for building application installation packages with user provided input.
