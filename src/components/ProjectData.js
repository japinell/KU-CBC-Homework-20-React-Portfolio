It allows users to search for products by category, save the products to a shopping cart, and finally, it allows to perform the checkout by calling the Stripe API with a demo key. The application was built using the MERN (Mongo, Express, React, and Node) Stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and NodeJS and ExpressJS server and API.",

The application is expected to run in tandem with an ERP system from which orders, items, customers, users, and other system parameters are pulled. The application keeps track of inventory by item, location, and lot, and keeps a separate record of inventory transactions in a cardex. It has been designed to support future development of core features of a WMS like receiving, replenishment, and barcode scanning.",

A key feature of the application is that it runs without a graphical interface for the front-end; instead, it uses Inquirer.JS to ask users predefined questions and act upon their responses. This might be useful in cases where a 'light-weight' application is needed, for instance, for remote server or service administration, or for building application installation packages with user provided input.
